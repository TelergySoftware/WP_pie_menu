# WP pie menu

### WP pie menu is an addon made for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) meant to help you change your Weight Paint Brushes faster.

## Installation

Just like any addon, you can install it by going to the **Addons** tab in the **User Preferences** window, clicking **install** and then locate the addon zip file and at last click **Install Add-on**.

## How to use

After installing the addon, you can use it by pressing the **D** key on your keyboard. It will open a pie menu with the following options:

- **Draw**: This will set the current brush to Draw.
- **Add**: This will set the current brush to Add.
- **Subtract**: This will set the current brush to Subtract.
- **Multiply**: This will set the current brush to Multiply.
- **Lighten**: This will set the current brush to Lighten.
- **Darken**: This will set the current brush to Darken.
- **Blur**: This will set the current brush to Blur.
- **Average**: This will set the current brush to Average.

The shortcut can be changed in the keymap preferences under the 3D View tab.

## Future plans

- Add a menu to let the user choose the brushes and the order in the pie menu.
- Add another pie menu to control the current brush properties.
